## Goals: 
### Develop a weather app that displays the current weather and 5 day forecast for a searched city utilizing openweather API, moment, jquery, css, html5, and bootstrap.

<br />

## Key Functionality:
* Input for city on load
* Search for a city and display the date, the location, and some basic weather information
* Generate a list of previous search history that is clickable to return to previous searches
* Produce the five day forecast for the searched city as well
* Update the cell around the UV index with colors corresponding to the value
* Provide an icon for the current weather conditions
* Provide the last city searched and the current weather at that location on load

### Additional Features
* Future weather cards update background depending on time of day
* List of previous searches are buttons instead of just a list

<br />

## Skills practiced: Jquery, Local Storage, Moment.js/APIs, CSS, Javascript, HTML

<br />

## Instructions:
* Load the page
* Enter a city to search for the weather
* Review displayed weather info
* Search any new cities or search previous cities from the search history list
* Any previous searches will be saved for user's return to the site
* Clear search history when finished with a trip or the list becomes unwieldy
